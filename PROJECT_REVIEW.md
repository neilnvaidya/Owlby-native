# Project Review & Audit Instructions

## How to Perform a Project Review (Repeatable Process)

1. **Enumerate all files and directories** in the project, excluding `node_modules` and other build artifacts.
2. **Read all configuration, environment, and documentation files** (e.g., `.env`, `README.md`, `package.json`, etc.).
3. **Systematically read all source files** in both frontend and backend, including all subdirectories.
4. **Check for empty or defunct directories and useless files**; delete or archive as appropriate.
5. **Synthesize a comprehensive report** covering:
   - Project status vs. plan
   - Environment/configuration health
   - Code quality and structure
   - Missing/incomplete/problematic areas
   - Actionable recommendations
6. **Document the review** in this file for future reference.

# Owlby Native: Comprehensive Project Review (as of this audit)

## 1. Project Status vs. Plan

- **Vision & Plan:**
  - Owlby Native is a mobile learning app for personalized, privacy-focused, AI-powered learning.
  - The README and migration_guide.md clearly outline a multi-sprint plan, with a focus on authentication, user profiles, chat, session management, and learning path visualization.
- **Current Status:**
  - Backend: Serverless, TypeScript, Supabase, JWT, REST API, with a full set of models, controllers, routes, and tests. All core authentication and user/learning node CRUD is implemented and tested.
  - Frontend: Modern Expo/React Native app, with navigation, authentication (Google OAuth), chat UI, and basic screens/components. Context-based auth state management is in place.
  - DevOps: EAS, Vercel, and Supabase are all integrated, with clear deployment and migration scripts and documentation.
- **Progress vs. Plan:**
  - Sprint 0 (Auth & App Setup): Nearly complete. Some UI polish and error/loading states remain.
  - Sprint 1 (User Profile): Backend models and endpoints are scaffolded, but UI and integration are not yet implemented.
  - Sprint 2+ (Chat, Sessions, Learning Paths): Some backend scaffolding exists, but most features are not yet implemented in the UI.

## 2. Environment & Configuration Health

- .env files: All required secrets and config are present and well-structured for local, preview, and production environments.
- .gitignore: Properly excludes secrets and build artifacts.
- EAS, Vercel, Supabase: All are configured for multi-environment deployment.
- Jest: Test environment is set up with dotenv and mocks.
- Metro/Babel/TS: All configs are minimal and correct for Expo/TypeScript.

## 3. Code Quality & Structure

- **Frontend (Expo/React Native):**
  - Structure: Modern, modular, and idiomatic. Uses Expo Router, context providers, and functional components.
  - Auth: Google OAuth is implemented and integrated with Supabase.
  - Chat: UI is present, but backend integration is stubbed (simulated responses).
  - Components: Well-organized, with reusable UI and auth components.
  - Testing: Some test scaffolding exists, but more coverage is needed for new features.
- **Backend (TypeScript, Serverless):**
  - Structure: Clean separation of models, controllers, routes, middleware, and utils.
  - Models: Comprehensive for users, learning nodes, sessions, paths, etc.
  - Controllers/Routes: RESTful, with proper error handling and middleware.
  - Testing: Good coverage for auth and learning nodes.
  - Migrations/Scripts: Well-documented and automated.
- **Legacy/Old Directory:**
  - Contains previous versions of most files, useful for reference or rollback.

## 4. Missing, Incomplete, or Problematic Areas

- **Frontend:**
  - User profile and preferences UI not yet implemented.
  - Chat UI does not connect to backend/AI yet.
  - Session management and learning path visualization are not present.
  - Some screens/components are stubs or placeholders.
  - Error/loading states and protected route handling are incomplete.
- **Backend:**
  - Some endpoints for advanced features (sessions, learning paths, analytics) are scaffolded but not fully implemented.
  - Some type mismatches (noted in README) need to be resolved, especially around JWT and user IDs.
  - No advanced analytics or AI integration yet.
- **Testing:**
  - Good coverage for core backend, but limited for new features and frontend.
- **Docs:**
  - Excellent overall, but some TODOs remain for documenting new features as they are built.

## 5. Actionable Recommendations

- **Short-Term:**
  - Complete Sprint 0 by finishing auth UI polish, error/loading states, and protected route handling.
  - Begin Sprint 1: Implement user profile UI and connect to backend.
  - Fix type mismatches in JWT/user ID handling.
  - Add more frontend tests, especially for auth and navigation.
- **Medium-Term:**
  - Integrate chat UI with backend and AI service.
  - Implement session management and learning path visualization.
  - Expand backend endpoints and models for sessions, paths, and analytics.
  - Add tests for new features as they are built.
- **Long-Term:**
  - Implement advanced analytics, privacy controls, and social features as outlined in the README.
  - Continuously update documentation and migration guides.
  - Consider code splitting and optimization as the app grows.

## 6. Overall Assessment

- This is a well-structured, modern, and thoughtfully planned project.
- You are on track with your roadmap, with a solid foundation for both frontend and backend.
- The next steps are clear: finish auth polish, build out user profile and chat, and then proceed to sessions and learning paths.
