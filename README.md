# Owlby Native

## Project Overview

Owlby Native is a mobile learning application that provides personalized educational experiences through AI-powered conversations. The application allows users to explore various topics, track their learning progress, and receive tailored content based on their interests and learning style.

### Core Concept

The app is designed to create an interactive, free-flowing learning experience where:

1. Users can have natural conversations with an AI about anything they want to learn
2. The AI adapts to the user's interests and learning style over time
3. Topics are not pre-selected but emerge organically from conversations
4. When the AI detects a new focus or topic in the conversation, a branch is created
5. Specialized learning modes can be activated at any point, creating new branches
6. Learning paths are not predictions but records of the user's learning journey
7. The app tracks learning progress and adapts content based on user performance
8. Learning sessions are summarized and stored for future reference
9. No chat histories are retained for privacy reasons, only summaries and learning insights
10. Each user has their personal AI assistant that knows their learning style but not specific personal information

### Key Features

- **Natural Conversations**: Free-flowing discussions with an AI about any topic
- **Organic Topic Discovery**: Topics emerge naturally from conversations rather than being pre-selected
- **Learning Path Visualization**: See how your learning journey has evolved over time
- **Adaptive Learning**: The AI adjusts its communication style based on your learning preferences
- **Privacy-Focused**: No chat histories are stored, only summaries and learning insights
- **Personalized Experience**: Your AI assistant learns your preferences while respecting your privacy

## Architecture

The project consists of two main components:

1. **Mobile App (React Native/Expo)**: The frontend application that users interact with
2. **Backend (Serverless Functions)**: API endpoints deployed as serverless functions that handle authentication, data storage, and AI interactions

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built with:
- **Serverless Functions**: Deployed on Vercel/Netlify
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication
- **JWT**: For secure authentication
- **RESTful API**: For communication with the mobile app

### Sprint 0: Detailed Task Breakdown & Code Suggestions

#### Authentication UI
- **Loading States**
  - Show a loading spinner/button state during login, registration, and session checks.
  - Example: Use a `loading` state in your auth forms and disable buttons while loading.
- **Error Handling**
  - Display error messages for failed logins/registrations (e.g., invalid credentials, network errors).
  - Example: Catch errors in your sign-in/sign-up functions and set an `error` state to display in the UI.
- **Email Verification UI**
  - After registration, prompt the user to verify their email.
  - Show a message if the user is not verified and provide a button to resend the verification email.
- **Tests for Auth Components**
  - Write tests for login, registration, and verification flows using Jest and React Native Testing Library.

#### App Setup
- **Protected Route Handling**
  - Redirect unauthenticated users to the login screen.
  - Example: In your navigation or route guards, check for a valid session before rendering protected screens.
- **Authentication State Management**
  - Ensure session persistence and handle session refresh on app start.
  - Example: Use `useEffect` in your AuthProvider to check and refresh the session.
- **Splash Screen and Loading States**
  - Show a splash/loading screen while checking authentication/session state on app launch.
- **Tests for Navigation and State Management**
  - Write tests to ensure protected routes and session management work as expected.

#### Known Issues
- **Type Mismatches**
  - Fix any type mismatches in JWT/user ID handling in the backend.

## Known Issues and Challenges

### Type Mismatch Issues
- There is a type mismatch between string and number for user IDs in JWT functions
- The `generateToken` function expects a number but receives a string
- The `verifyToken` function returns a number but the auth middleware expects a string
- This causes TypeScript compilation errors and needs to be fixed

### Port Conflicts
- The server sometimes encounters port conflicts when running multiple instances
- The server is configured to try the next available port when the default port is in use
- This can lead to inconsistent port usage across restarts
- The server will automatically try ports 3000, 3001, 3002, etc. until it finds an available one

### Database Connection
- The Supabase connection is working but there were initial issues with the connection string format
- The correct format for Supabase hostnames is `[project-id].supabase.co`
- The connection is tested on server startup to ensure it's working properly

### Deprecation Warnings
- There is a deprecation warning for the `punycode` module
- This is a Node.js internal warning and doesn't affect functionality
- It can be addressed in future updates if needed

## Context for Future Development
